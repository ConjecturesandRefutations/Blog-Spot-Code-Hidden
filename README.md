# Blog-Spot-Code-Hidden
A blog website built using PHP and a MySQL database. Create, update and delete blogs. Create, update and delete feedback. Profile pages for each user. Image upload functionality. Basic messaging functionality. Ability to save blogs as drafts rather than publish. Search functionality.

I have hidden the code because too much work has gone into this. But please take a look at the website: https://blogspot.host
